# Loginpage-snippet
In this code snippet, we have a basic login page component in React. The useState hook is used to manage the form data, which includes fields for email and password. The handleChange function updates the form data as the user types in the input fields. The handleSubmit function is triggered when the form is submitted, where you can send a login request to the server, handle authentication, and perform any necessary actions.

This code assumes that you have set up a server using Express.js and have an appropriate route for handling the login request on the backend. Additionally, you'll need to handle storing the authentication token or session on successful login and implement any necessary redirection logic.

Remember to customize and adapt this code to fit your specific authentication requirements, such as adding validation, integrating with a backend API, and handling authentication responses accordingly.
